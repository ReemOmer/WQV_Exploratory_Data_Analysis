# Water_Quality_Variables_Prediction
These files contains all the exploration, analysis, prediction and accuracy comparison for water quaity variables. These variables are chemical, biological and physical characterstics of the water which are used to determine the quality of water and its use.
The dataset obtained from the United States of Geological Survey (USGS) specifically from the Hog island station: https://waterdata.usgs.gov/ny/nwis/uv?site_no=01311143
Water quality variables used in this experiment were 12 such as pH, specific conductance, temperature, etc. and it saved in 3 csv files (due to the hugeness), each file contains 4 variables.
Kindly make sure that you have these 3 files and all the required library installed in your machine.
